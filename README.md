# Software Design
Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices.

## The SOLID Principles

- The Single Responsibility Principle
- The Open-Closed Principle
- The Liskov Substitution Principle
- The Interface Segregation Principle
- The Dependency Inversion Principle

### The Single Responsibility Principle (**SRP**)
Each class should be responsible for a single part of the system's functionality. 

### The Open-Closed Principle (**OCP**)
Software components should be open for extension but not for modification.

### The Liskov Substitution Principle (**LSP**)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system.

### The Interface Segregation Principle (**ISP**)
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 

### The Dependency Inversion Principle (**DIP**)
High-level modules should be independent of low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
